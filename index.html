		<h2>About me</h2>

		<p>NYC-based realtor and hopefully web developer in the near future. I believe that visual part of code is equally important to its content. Thus web design and development should be given the utmost attention. I would like to combine the business ideas I have in mind with the proper web presentation, that hopefully will help many people.</p>

		<p>To be honest this is super difficult to write about oneself, especially yourself. Nevertheless I will admit that I am quite a brave person, who moved from Russia around 6 years ago all by myself and call New York my home now. Hope you all enjoyed the information!</p>
